### Dataset Description

This project utilizes two datasets for training and evaluation:

1. **Original Dataset**: 
   - Contains the raw images collected manually from hydroponic farming systems.
   - **Size**: 247 images.
   - **Download Link**: [Original Dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/original-dataset-url)
   - These images represent the base dataset without any modifications.

2. **Augmented Dataset**: 
   - This dataset was generated by applying **data augmentation techniques** to the original dataset using Roboflow.
   - **Size**: Over 1,000 images.
   - **Download Link**: [Augmented Dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/augmented-dataset-url)
   - Each original image produces **7 augmented variations**, leading to a significantly larger dataset.

### Augmentation Techniques

The following augmentations were applied to create the augmented dataset:
- **Brightness Adjustment**:
  - Images were adjusted to vary brightness between **-15%** and **+15%**.
  - This simulates real-world conditions with varying light intensities.
- **Augmentation Count**:
  - For each original image, **7 new variations** were created, resulting in a total of over **1,000 images**.

### Dataset Comparison

| **Dataset**        | **Size** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Original**        | 247      | Raw images as collected from hydroponic systems, unmodified.                   |
| **Augmented**       | 1147     | Augmented images created by applying transformations to simulate real-world scenarios. |

Both datasets are made available for download to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Users can choose to train the model on the original dataset or benefit from the augmented dataset's improved generalization.
